# Pagene

The simple Static Blog JSON files generator.

## Why?

1. **Static JSON files**. You don't need to buy server.
1. **Supports tags**! Yay! Also you can make tag cloud!

## Contribution

### Pull request

1. **Do pull request for applying issues/minor fix (typo)**, don't add pull request to master. PR is always to **experimental** branch.
1. Bug fixes welcome, always, if the code is tested (Unless it's feature :P)
1. Improving performance is good contribution, but maintainability is more important than small performance optimization.
1. English syntax fix is always welcomed, please fix us!

### Issue

1. **Search for open/closed issue first** before submitting a new issue.
1. Suggestions, including feature suggestions, are welcomed, but they can be either accepted or rejected.
1. There are some **Bug/Feature/Documentation template** so please use them!
1. You can also just ask usage. But we also have **[documentation](https://rnielikki.github.io/Pagene)**!
