# Pagene
The simple Static Blog files generator.

## Motivation
I don't have money to use server, even function is not copmletely free. I need to start a blog, so let me see static page generators...

Forget it. I can make API generator with my taste and I'll decorate.

But hey, **this is for everyone**.
