> Note: If it's small typo, you can do directly PR. Use this for typo/unclear text issue, only if you don't know how to fix it.

**Which part of the documentation is?**
You can mention specific code, or just 'usage of something'. 📑
e.g. `Pagene.Converter.BuildAync()` (code part), about configuration (non-code part)...
If it's not a new documentation requirement and non-code part, give more detail about which part (e.g. Getting Started -> Index) it is.

**What is the problem?**
e.g. Explanation is not clear, there are typo, I need more explanation, documentation is too trivial... ⁉️

**Suggestion**
This part will be more clear by replacing with... 💡
